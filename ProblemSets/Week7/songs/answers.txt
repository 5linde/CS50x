With the average of energy, valence and danceabiity being 0.65906, 0.484443 and 0.71646, we see that the person has above average energy and danceability but below average valence.
Comparing this to the different auras I think that the person would have purple or blue audio aura.

Purple aura: This aura color pairs well with passionate music listeners. Purple auras tune in to get amped up, entertained, and moving while they navigate the twists and turns of their day.
Blue: Blues are wistful or emotional, and this hue reflects listeners who seek out music to feel their feelings out loud.

This way of calculating the audio aura might not be very representative of the listener since the factors are pretty limited. A better way to calculate the audio aura could be to take into account
the genre and mood of the songs, if possible maybe time of day that the listener listened to the song.
