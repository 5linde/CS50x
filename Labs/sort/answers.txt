sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Performs fairly good on the sorted txts but far worse on the randomly sorted ones. This makes sense since bubble sort has better lower bound than upper bound time complexity.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: This sorting algorithm performs better for random sorted txts which makes sense since the upper bound for merge sort is better than the other two algorithms.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: It has the worst lower bound performance OMEGA(n^2), so running it on the sorted txt took the longest time by far.
